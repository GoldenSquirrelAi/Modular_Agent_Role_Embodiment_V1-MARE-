## Abstract

The Modular Agent Role Embodiment (MARE) Protocol defines a standardized framework for scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems.

MARE introduces two complementary sub-protocols:
- **MAP (Modular Agent Protocol)**: A lightweight orchestration layer for task routing.
- **REP (Role Embodiment Protocol)**: A specification for defining and injecting execution roles into adaptive agents.

This specification describes the architecture, execution flows, compliance requirements, and security considerations for MARE-compliant implementations.

---

## 1. Introduction

Current multi-agent systems suffer from inefficiencies, behavioral drift, compliance risks, and scaling complexity. MARE addresses these challenges by separating orchestration (MAP) from execution identity (REP).

- MAP routes tasks to the correct execution agent.
- REP provides consistent, role-specific behavior and constraints during task execution.

By unifying orchestration and role embodiment, MARE-compliant systems achieve 80%+ token efficiency, linear scalability, and auditable compliance guarantees.

---

## 2. Terminology

- **MUST**: Absolute requirement.
- **SHOULD**: Recommended unless strong reason otherwise.
- **MAY**: Optional, left to implementer.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 MAP (Modular Agent Protocol)

```
TASK → ROUTER → RUNNER_AGENT → OUTPUT
```

- **Router**: Decomposes tasks and assigns execution flow.
- **Runner Agent**: A neutral execution container.
- **MCP Integration**: Provides tool access in a standardized manner.

### 3.2 REP (Role Embodiment Protocol)

```
RETRIEVE_REP → INJECT_REP → EXECUTE → OUTPUT → CONTEXT_WIPE
```

- **Retrieve REP**: Query role profile from repository.
- **Inject REP**: Apply behavioral instructions, tone, and constraints.
- **Execute**: Complete task with role embodiment.
- **Context Wipe**: Clear temporary state after execution.

---

## 4. REP Schema

A REP object MUST conform to the following schema:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "version": "semver",
  "archetype": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "system_prompt": "string",
  "tone_guide": "object",
  "constraints": "array",
  "preferred_models": "array",
  "tool_access": "object",
  "confidence_thresholds": "object"
}
```

### Example:

```json
{
  "name": "COO_REP",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "archetype": "Operations Coordinator",
  "description": "Ensures workflows run efficiently and in compliance.",
  "system_prompt": "You are the COO role. Your priorities are compliance, standardization, and efficiency.",
  "tone_guide": { "style": "structured", "formatting": "tables" },
  "constraints": ["Must log all actions", "Escalate on policy conflicts"],
  "preferred_models": ["claude-3-opus", "llama-3-70b"],
  "tool_access": { "ops_mcp": ["KnowledgeBase", "ComplianceAPI"] },
  "confidence_thresholds": { "auto_complete": 0.8, "escalate": 0.5 }
}
```

## 5. Execution Flow

1. **Task Ingestion**: Request enters MAP router.
2. **Decomposition**: Task is broken into atomic operations.
3. **REP Selection**: Matching REP retrieved from repository.
4. **Injection**: Runner Agent initialized with REP instructions.
5. **Execution**: Task completed with role-specific behavior.
6. **Confidence Evaluation**: Agent self-assesses output.
7. **Completion/Escalation**: Output returned or escalated.
8. **Context Wipe**: Agent returns to neutral state.

---

## 6. Minimum Implementation Requirements

### 6.1 Orchestrator (MAP Router)

- MUST support task decomposition and dependency mapping.
- MUST integrate with REP repository.
- SHOULD implement rollback and escalation mechanisms.

### 6.2 Runner Agent

- MUST support REP injection.
- MUST implement context isolation.
- SHOULD provide self-evaluation with confidence scoring.

### 6.3 REP Repository

- MUST support versioning and schema validation.
- SHOULD support inheritance and templating.
- MAY support A/B testing of role behaviors.

---

## 7. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

- Implementations MUST support redundant orchestrators with health checks.
- Implementations SHOULD provide offline REP caching.
- Implementations MUST enforce execution timeouts with rollback.
- Critical REPs MUST have fallback defaults.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

- Tool access MUST be restricted to REP-defined scopes.
- All REP objects MUST be encrypted at rest.
- Actions MUST be logged with REP attribution for auditability.
- Context isolation MUST prevent data leakage between roles.

---

## 9. Compliance and Governance

- REPs MUST be versioned and traceable.
- Implementations MUST support audit logging.
- Role deviations SHOULD trigger alerts.
- Organizations MAY adopt approval workflows for REP changes.

---

## 10. Performance Benchmarks (Projected)

- **Token Efficiency**: 80–85% reduction over persistent multi-agent systems.
- **Latency**: <2s routine, <30s complex.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% completion with properly defined REPs.
- **Scalability**: Linear to 1000+ concurrent workflows.

---

## 11. Adoption Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core MAP/REP integration with basic REPs.
- **Phase 2**: Compliance frameworks, audit trails, optimization.
- **Phase 3**: Ecosystem growth with community REP marketplace.

---

## 12. Licensing and Open Source Commitment

This specification is released under the MIT License to encourage community-driven development, interoperability, and standardization across enterprise AI systems.

---

## 13. Call to Action

The MARE Protocol defines a practical and auditable standard for role-based AI orchestration. Industry feedback, implementation partners, and standards body collaboration are requested.
