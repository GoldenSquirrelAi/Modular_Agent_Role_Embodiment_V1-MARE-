## Build Process Overview

### Meta-Circular Construction Methodology

The MARE system was built using the MARE Protocol itself through sequential REP embodiment:

1. **SOFTWARE_ARCHITECT_REP** → System architecture design
2. **BACKEND_DEVELOPER_REP** → Core implementation  
3. **PROTOCOL_DESIGNER_REP** → RFC compliance validation
4. **TEST_ENGINEER_REP** → Testing and validation frameworks
5. **DEVOPS_ENGINEER_REP** → Deployment and operations infrastructure

**Total Build Phases:** 5  
**Sequential REP Embodiments:** 5  
**Construction Approach:** Meta-circular (system builds itself)
