# MARE MVP: Self-Building System PRD

## Project Goal
Build a working MARE (Modular Agent Role Embodiment) system that demonstrates its own value by using MARE principles to construct itself.

## Core Deliverable
A functional MVP that routes tasks to role-specific agents, proving 80%+ token efficiency through live demonstration.

## Task Decomposition

### 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
**Assigned to**: Software Architect REP
**Deliverable**: Complete system design with component specifications
**Input**: MARE RFC + MVP requirements
**Output**: Architecture diagram, component specs, data flow design

### 2. CORE IMPLEMENTATION  
**Assigned to**: Backend Developer REP
**Deliverable**: Working router, REP injector, and runner agent
**Input**: Architecture specs + REP schema
**Output**: Python/JS implementation with MCP integrations

### 3. PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE
**Assigned to**: Protocol Designer REP  
**Deliverable**: MARE-compliant implementation validation
**Input**: RFC specification + implementation code
**Output**: Compliance checklist, gap analysis, recommendations

### 4. DEMO & VALIDATION
**Assigned to**: Test Engineer REP
**Deliverable**: Proof scenarios + token efficiency measurement  
**Input**: Working system + test requirements
**Output**: Demo scenarios, validation scripts, metrics dashboard

### 5. DEPLOYMENT & DEMO
**Assigned to**: DevOps Engineer REP
**Deliverable**: Running system with live demo capability
**Input**: Implemented system + demo scenarios  
**Output**: Deployed system, demo script, performance metrics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] System routes 5 different task types to appropriate REPs
- [ ] Demonstrates measurable token efficiency vs baseline
- [ ] REPs maintain consistent role-specific behavior
- [ ] Live demo ready with side-by-side comparison
- [ ] Meta proof: MARE built itself using MARE principles

## Technical Requirements
- REP repository with 5+ role definitions
- Task router with pattern matching
- Runner agent with REP injection
- Token usage tracking and comparison
- CLI interface for live demonstration

## Bootstrap Requirements
- This system must use itself to coordinate its own construction
- Each REP must embody domain expertise authentically  
- Final system must be MARE RFC compliant
- Implementation must prove the protocol's core claims
